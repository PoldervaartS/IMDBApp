# IMDBApp

# Goals
This application will be used by film buffs to submit various querries. These querries include the modular search of two people finding films that they are related modularly. This functions from choosing Director, Producer, or an Actor. Another possibe query is to input a span of years, and the user will be retutned a minimum spanning list of actors or directors who consecutively worked on films in those years. Finally, the users can input two actors and they will be returned a list of films with degrees of separation between the two actors.

Created our own database that is run off of the A&M Servers. The information that is stored in this database is pulled from IMDB and was parsed into respective tables. 

For building locally, must have jdk, and have the postgresql jar
# Will not function anymore as the database does not exist after conclusion of the project
